            Founded in 2019, UBA began its journey with a commitment to excellence in hospitality and
            bartending education. As the world faced the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19
            pandemic, UBA quickly adapted by launching online classes, providing young people with
            continued access to quality education. The positive response from students and their growing
            interest led UBA to establish itself as a recognized educational company in Thaketa Township.
            Today, UBA continues to empower the next generation of hospitality professionals, equipping
            them with the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in the dynamic world of hospitality and
            bartending.
